        Born and raised in Emilia, I moved to The Netherlands to see if a piece of land can be more flat than the Pianura Padana (it can!). 
        Although I bike in the rain like a true Hollander, my body keeps running on parmesan and tortellini, which I stock up regularly from the source.

        I got a MSc in Systems and Control from TU Delft and now I come up with pieces of software that aim to make a better use of the existing electrical infrastructure. 
        I do this at <a href="http://spectral.energy/about/" style="text-decoration: none;">Spectral</a> with tens of other committed and bright minds.

        I find great pleasure in diving deep into entangled matters. When I don't get stuck myself, I enjoy crafting
        (hopefully) clearer but still accurate stories, and sharing them around.
        Humans, nature and technology seem to have a talent for creating complex scenarios, I am lucky!
        This space was born in the attempt of capturing and shaping this storytelling energy.
