        Born and raised in Emilia, I moved to The Netherlands to see if a piece of land can be more flat than the Pianura Padana (it can!). 
        Although I bike in the rain like a true Hollander, my body keeps running on parmesan and tortellini, which I stock up regularly from the source.

        I got a MSc in Systems and Control from TU Delft and now I come up with pieces of software that aim to make a better use of the existing electrical infrastructure. 
        I do this at <a href="http://spectral.energy/about/" style="text-decoration: none;">Spectral</a> with tens of other committed and bright minds.

        I believe connecting different ideas and disciplines together is one of the greatest wonder in life.
        It is also an extraordinaty tool we as humans have, to move forward in a more aware and collaborative way.
        Finally, metaphors and symbols can make things much simpler and funnier to understand... and our world is already complex and gray enough, don't you think?
